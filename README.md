Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a simple calculator using HTML and CSS. The calculator will perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for performing calculations conveniently within a web browser. The key objectives include:

Implementing a visually appealing user interface using HTML and CSS.
Incorporating functionality for basic arithmetic operations.
Ensuring responsive design to provide a consistent user experience across different devices.
Facilitating easy input and output of numbers for calculation purposes.
Enhancing accessibility and usability through clear labeling and intuitive design elements.
Overview:
The calculator will be built using HTML for structuring the layout and CSS for styling purposes. It will consist of various components including number buttons, operator buttons, and a display area to show the calculation results. The overview of the project includes the following steps:

HTML Structure: Define the basic structure of the calculator interface using HTML elements such as divs, buttons, and a display area.

CSS Styling: Apply CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of the calculator, including colors, fonts, button designs, and layout adjustments for responsiveness.

Button Functionality: Implement JavaScript functionality to handle button clicks, capture user input, and perform arithmetic operations based on the selected buttons.

Calculation Logic: Develop the logic for performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

Display Management: Update the display area with the result of calculations and ensure that it reflects the ongoing input from the user.

Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to manage scenarios such as division by zero and invalid input.

Testing and Refinement: Test the calculator thoroughly across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and functionality. Refine the design and functionality based on user feedback and testing results.

By following this overview and implementing each step effectively, we aim to create a fully functional calculator application that meets the objectives outlined above.
